# SecuritySMP
Plugin I made for an SMP server for me and some friends. Probably the largest plugin ive ever worked on. This is simply open source for the purpose of being open source, I currently have no intention of releasing any form of the plugin.

The plugins main feature is to build up security on your base, so people dont steal your stuff. Every feature in this plugin has a subsequent drawback to it which relates to
the security feature being broken.

# Doors
- Keypad Door - Lockpick time: 600s
- Eyescanner Door - Not lockpickable (See heads category for detail).
- Key locked Door - Lockpick time: 120s

# Computer
The computer has multiple features, which include a:

- Shop where players can put up items for any price.
- A terminal window, where you can DDoS other players with computers and find an aproximate location. (Yes its unrealistic I know but like, cmon, its Minecraft.)
- Camera interface, players can access their placed cameras through this.

The computer cannot be broken when placed, only allowed players can access this.

# Defensive Measures
- Cameras, can be accessed through the computer
- A key, which can lock doors and chests (Key becomes linked to whatever you locked)
- A Cell tower, which protects blocks within a 30 block radius. Players other than the owner cannot break or place blocks. (The only breakable block by players other than the owner is the cell tower itself)

# Offensive Measures
- A lockpick, which can lockpick doors.
- The ability to get another players head to use their eyescanner door.

# Money
Money is currently only used for the shop in the computer. Players need to have the money in their inventory for the transaction to complete.
All money is physical, in one dollar bills. The limit for players to hold is $2070.

- /bal - Shows how much money you currently have in your inventory.
- /givemoney player amount - Gives player money.

# Heads
Players killed with swords will drop their head. This head will be good for three IRL days, until then, it will be usable on eyescanner doors. When the head rots, it turns into
a zombie skull.
  
# Teams
All owner exclusive things are bypassed if the player is on a team owned by the owner of the object they are interacting with.

- /team help - Gives a help GUI
